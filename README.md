# InstaBoard

InstaBoard is a React application that displays a list of user profile cards fetched from the Random User API.  
Users can like profiles, toggle email visibility, search users by name, and switch between light and dark themes.
 


 ## Challenges

- Managing state for likes and email visibility on each card.
- Implementing real-time search filter.
- Handling asynchronous API calls with Axios.
- Styling the components for a clean UI and responsive layout.
